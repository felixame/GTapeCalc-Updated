# gtapecalcmod

A fork of http://gtapecalc.sourceforge.net/, licensed under GPLv3.

Fixed a couple issues that kept gtapecalc from being compiled on modern distros and brought it over to a modern build system. This is one of my first desktop oriented projects on Linux so I haven't bothered to include a .desktop file or to fix the application icon. 

### Building
All you should have to do to build the project is `ninja -C bin`.

From there it can be run from `bin/src/gtapecalc`.
