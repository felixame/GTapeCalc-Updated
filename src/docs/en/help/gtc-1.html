Gtapecalc is a simple calculator that has the added feature of an output window listing the 
calculations that you make. It is especially useful for calculating lists of numbers where you 
enter many numbers in from the keyboard without looking at the screen and want to check to 
make sure that you didn't make a mistake.<P>

You can add notes to the calculations that you make and save the output to a file which 
can be opened and added to later. The notes can be edited after a file has been saved, but
the calculations can not preserving their integrity.
<P>
Gtapecalc is clone of the Windows utility "Tapecalc
Copyright 1995 by Neil J. Rubenking first published in
PC Magazine  Feb 7, 1995, U.S. Edition" with some added features,
however it shares no code with it. It was a utility that I had always
found useful in Windows but had no equivalent in Linux.
