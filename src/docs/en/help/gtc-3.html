<CENTER><H1>Usage</H1></CENTER>
<P>

You can use gtapecalc just like you would most other calculators.
The main difference is the output window that will record any calculations 
that you enter. 
<P>

<H3><A NAME="ss3.1"></A>3.1 Adding Notes</H3>

On each line in the output window you can add notes 
by selecting the row with the mouse or the arrow keys and clicking in the
'Notes' column of the selected row or by right clicking on the line that you
want to add a note to and select 'Add Note' from the menu. A dialog will pop
up where you can enter the note you want to add and click 'Insert' to add it
to the line. You can also add notes by double-clicking on the line, selecting
the line you want with the mouse and using the 'Edit-Add Note' menu entry or
by using the arrow keys to highlight the row you want and the spacebar to
select it.

<H3><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 User Preferences</A></H3>

All user preferences can be set using the preferences dialog  which is accessed
from the 'Edit' menu. They are saved in two files, .<STRONG>gtapecalcrc</STRONG> and 
<STRONG>.gtapecalcgtkrc</STRONG> which are located in the users home directory. The 
<STRONG>.gtapecalcrc</STRONG> file is for program specific configuration options, while 
<STRONG>.gtapecalcgtkrc</STRONG> is for options that can be affected by different gtk 
themes such as fonts for the buttons and output window. These files are only 
generated when you click OK in the preferences dialog and are not needed 
by gtapecalc to operate. They are overwritten every time you save a preference 
so editing them manually is not recommended. If they don't exist, then the program
will start with a default set of preferences which should be adequate for most 
situations
<P>

<blockquote><H3>View</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><H4><A NAME="ss3.2.1">3.2.1 Precision</A></H4>
	The Precision option sets the calculator's precision. Any changes made in the 
	<STRONG>Preferences</STRONG> dialog will be saved and used the next time the 
	program is run. Precision can also be set using the options <STRONG>View</STRONG> 
	in the view menu. Changes made here will not be saved for the next session.
	<P>

	<LI><H4><A NAME="ss3.2.2">3.2.2 Show Column Headers</A></H4>
	Show or hide the column headers in the Tape Output window.
	<P>
		
	<LI><H4><A NAME="ss3.2.3">3.2.3 Save Current Window Size</A></H4>
	Save the current size of the program window along with the sizes of the individual panes.
	So if you would like to see only the output window and not the buttons, resize the panes 
	to show only the output window and use this option to make gtapecalc start this way all 
	the time.
	<P>
</UL>

<H3>Fonts</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><H4><A NAME="ss3.2.4">3.2.4 Calculator Font</A></H4>
	Sets the font for the calculator display. Currently the display does not resize itself to account 
	for different sized fonts, so choosing a font that is too large for the display may result in 
	numbers not being visible.
	<P>

	<LI><H4><A NAME="ss3.2.5">3.2.5 Tape Font</A></H4>
	Sets the font for the output window.
	<P>

	<LI><H4><A NAME="ss3.2.6">3.2.6 Button Font</A></H4>
	Sets the font for the calculator buttons.
	<P>
	<EM>(Note)</EM> The system used for setting fonts is something of a 
	tradeoff between being flexible for both the user and with Gtk themes. The 
	problem is that sometimes the fonts aren't always updated correctly-or the 
	theme isn't always updated correctly. However, when the program is 
	restarted the correct font and theme will be shown.
	<P>
</UL>

<H3>Printing</H3>
<UL>

	<LI><H4><A NAME="ss3.2.7">3.2.7 Print Command</A></H4>
	Use this option to set the name of the printer command for your system. The default is 
	<STRONG>lpr</STRONG> so for most systems this should be fine.
	<P>

	<LI><H4><A NAME="ss3.2.8">3.2.8 Page Width</A></H4>
	Sets the width of the page to be printed in characters. Use this option to adjust the width of 
	the printed page.
	<P>

	<LI><H4><A NAME="ss3.2.9">3.2.9 Column Width</A></H4>
	Sets the width of the <STRONG>Notes</STRONG> column. Use this option to balance out 
	the widths of the printed columns to your personal preference. The default setting is one-
	half the <STRONG>Page Width</STRONG> setting.
	<P>
