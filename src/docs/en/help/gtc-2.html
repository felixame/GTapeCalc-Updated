<P>

To install gtapecalc you will need to download the source code 
and unpack the file with a command like 'tar -xvzf gtapecalc-0.3.x'.
<P>
Change into the newly created directory and enter the command 
'./configure'. The configure script checks some things about 
your system and creates the Makefiles that will build the program.
<P>
 If all goes well with configure you next type 'make'  and If there 
are no problems with make then you need to use 'make install' 
to install the program and it's associated files to their respective 
locations. You will need to use the root account on your system to
install the program into the default location.
<P>
The default location for gtapecalc files is /usr/local which means that 
a directory "/usr/local/share/gtapecalc" will be created when installing 
to hold the images and docs that gtapecalc uses, and put the excecutable 
in "/usr/local/bin". This location can be changed with an option to configure
 (-- prefix) so that you can install these files anywhere you want.
<P>
So if you want to want to install the files to say your home directory 
because you don't have root access you would use the command
'configure --prefix=/home/my_home_dir'. This will create the directories
"/home/my_home_dir/share/gtapecalc" and "/home/my_home_dir/bin" to 
install the files to.
<P>
There are other less used options to configure that can be listed with the
command './configure --help'.

<H3><A NAME="ss2.1"></A>2.1 Upgrading</H3>
If you are upgrading from a version prior to 1.1 then it is recommended that
you delete the <STRONG>.gtapecalcrc</STRONG> and <STRONG>.gtapecalcgtkrc</STRONG>
files from your home directory. Gtk2 has changed the way fonts are described so
any font settngs in the old files will no longer work. It will not hurt anything
for you to start the newer version with the old files, but you may get fonts that
do not look so good. Instead of deleting the files you may also start the program
with the old files and go to the preferences dialog and choose new fonts but it
is generally better to delete the old files and start from the defaults.
